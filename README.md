Bank Marketing Campaign

In this project we analyse a marketing campaign data of an international bank to identify the clients who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit along side the main factors that affect client's decision. This allows the marketing department to target future campaigns to these clients and saving costs in direct contact calls and advertising.
